##React Calculator Example
A simple project for exploring React 16--I built this mostly to study and gain more familiarity with React component structure, routing (v4) and conditional rendering. Also I wanted to use all native HTML/React elements throughout the form fields, pass all state up to the parent calculator and use stateful and stateless components where appropriate. Native HTML range sliders and number fields where used for convenience. Not all of the styling is fully vetted cross-browser due to this project being built to study React and it's associated packages more so than anything else.  

To run this project locally simply clone the repo and run `npm start` to launch the development server at `http://localhost:3000`. See package.json for all run commands. You will need [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed to run this project locally.
